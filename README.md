Advanced Ores Modification for Minecraft Forge 1.7.2

This mod aims to provide Minecraft Forge users a new experience containing multiple new ores
that generate naturally within all newly created worlds.

The ores are used to create new blocks, items, weapons, armours and more!

This is my first time working with Minecraft Forge (And Java!), so it may be slightly sloppy. I am mainly doing this
as a project for myself to learn how to code with Java and the Minecraft Forge API. I doubt anybody will find a use
for it, but if you do, enjoy!

Every file contained within the repo is welcome for use, you can edit it, burn it and the what-not. I only request that
if you do end up making something with this and releasing it to the public, that you give me credit where credit is due.

Enjoy the mod!
